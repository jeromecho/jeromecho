ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jerome, a current computer science *sophomore* at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. 

This is what I'm up to: 

- Web-based projects using the *MERN* stack and *AWS*
- *Object Detection* @UBCAgroBot 
- *Microcontroller programming* with Arduino 

This is some things I've done in the past: 

- Systems programming with *Rust *
- *Teaching* as a teaching assistant with my university's Department of Computer Science

If you want to chat or work on something interesting together, you can find me on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerome-cho-9a3059200/.
