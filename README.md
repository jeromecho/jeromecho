ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jerome @jeromecho, a current computer science sophomore at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. 

Right now, i am working predominantly on web-based projects using the MERN stack and AWS, but I also do some casual machine learning at my engineering design team @UBCAgroBot as part of the Image Recognition Subteam. I've dabbled in Rust and hardware and am interested in those fields but am definitely not fluent. I'm also very interested in teaching and education and have worked for my university as a teaching assistant for our introductory computer science course. 

If you want to chat or work on something interesting together, you can find me on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerome-cho-9a3059200/.
