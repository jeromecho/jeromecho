ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jerome, a current computer science **sophomore** at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. 

This is what I'm up to right now: 

- Web-based projects using the **MERN** stack and **AWS**
- **Object Detection** @UBCAgroBot using *PyTorch & OpenCV*
- **Microcontroller programming** with Arduino 

These are some things I've done in the past: 

- Systems programming with **Rust**
- **Teaching** as a teaching assistant with my university's Department of Computer Science

These are some activites I love to do and that might make for an interesting conversation 

- Fishing (*30+ species* caught, currently learning fly fishing) 
- Meditation 

If you want to chat or work on something interesting together, you can contact me here:
