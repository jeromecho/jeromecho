ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jerome, a current 3rd year computer science student at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. 

This is what I'm up to right now: 

- Web-based projects using the MERN stack and AWS
- Object Detection @UBCAgroBot using PyTorch & OpenCV
- Serving as a Computer Science Teaching Assistant 

These are some things I've done in the past: 

- Systems programming with Rust

These are some activites I love to do and that might make for an interesting conversation 

- Fishing (salt, river, lake) 

If you want to chat or work on something interesting together, you can contact me here:
